# APP STORE CONNECT - DEMO MODE NOTES

## Pour le Relecteur Apple (To the Apple Reviewer)
Dear Reviewer,

Our application Koiny is a **simulation tool** created for families to track their children's virtual pocket money and chores. There is NO real money involved and NO link to any bank account.

**Account Access:**
- A valid user account can be created during the login process to synchronize family settings to the cloud.
- Alternatively, you can use the built-in **DEMO MODE**. 

**How to test the App using Demo Mode:**
1. Tap "Essayer Koiny" (Try Koiny/Demo mode) at the bottom of the Landing View.
2. It will instantly generate a pre-filled local state, featuring demo kids (Léo, Emma) with mocked savings and active chores.
3. You can explore the application as a Child by selecting their profile.

**Accessing Parental Controls in Demo Mode:**
- To modify budgets or approve chores, access the "Espace Parents" (Parent Section).
- The PIN code for this demo mode is: `0000`.
- Once logged in with `0000`, you can grant/remove virtual money, validate chores, and manage the demo kids profiles.

Thank you very much! No hidden content, and no external purchases exist.
